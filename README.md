# Ape

Ape is an _array processing engine_. It takes an array of records and gives you a convenient interface to operate on it. Operations are processed in batch.

## Installation

You can install `ape` with NPM or Yarn:

```shell
npm install --save @fec/ape
yarn add @fec/ape
```

## Usage

`ape` does only have a single export, the titular `Ape` class. You add operations, such as `map()` or `renameKey()` and then process the given array.

```javascript
import Ape from 'ape';

const ape = new Ape([{ a: 'val 1' }, { a: 'val 2' }]);
const data = ape
  .map((record) => ({ a: record.a.toUpperCase() }))
  .renameKey('a', 'b')
  .process();
// ‚Üí [{ b: 'VAL 1' }, { b: 'VAL 2' }]
```

You can find a list of all operations and methods `Ape` provides in the [Ape API docs](https://ape.const.sh/main/index.html).
